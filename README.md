### Installation Steps
Fire up you terminal and run the given commands provided that you have python and pip perfectly up and running
```
pip install pyttsx3
```
In case you receive such errors: 
No module named win32com.client
No module named win32
No module named win32api
run the following command and repeat the previous step:
```
pip install pypiwin32
```
Now as soon as the previous installation is complete run the next command:
```
pip install speechRecognition
```
```
pip install wikipedia
```
Now you are ready to go. Just clone the repository and run the main.pyw file



### Note: The pyw extention is used instead of py extension so that as soon as you run the file you do not get the command prompt like interface. This can be used in python projects like apps and games so that the disturbing cmd doesn't pop up
